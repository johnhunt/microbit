*tableMaster.py* is a little times tables flash card game I've written to help my step daughter learn her times tables. It's very simple, but hopefully quite effective. I realise the sleep() calls are blocking to the UI, and had I had more time I would have programmed in proper event handlers. Also interesting is that I don't know my times tables myself, so hopefully we'll both get something out of it!
